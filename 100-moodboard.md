title: Log - 100 days of moodboard

---


##### Day 1: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Created first post. Named the theme of this year to be _vibe check_. Pretentious? Yes. Classic? Yes. A right choice? Absolutely.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited. The website, which I stayed overnight creating, looks stunning. Also, I may want to change the title to month of posts.

**Link to work:** On local host.

##### Day 2: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added scenes from my drive to gym, and warhol paintings.

**Thoughts:** This week I'm feeling warhol for the most part. I'm thinking how to make this less warhol-centric. But then it's a _moodboard_, so it's supposed to reflect my current mood.

## Who

My name is Zul. I'm from KL, Malaysia. 

## What

Currently, I'm focusing on solving all the problems from abbott's understanding analysis. See my [solutions](https://zulfadz.github.io/abbott-solution/) and [notes](https://zulfadz.github.io/abbott/).

I am also working on other projects. Notes and solutions will be posted as soon as they become available:

+ coursera on [computers, waves, simulations]((https://www.coursera.org/learn/computers-waves-simulations)). ([**notes**](https://zul.rocks/waves-coursera/))<span style="color:gray">(projects)</span>
+ axler's linear algebra done right. <span style="color:gray">(notes)</span>([**solutions**](https://zul.rocks/axler-linearalgebra-solution/))
+  berkeley's python programming and numerical methods. <span style="color:gray">(notes)(solutions)</span>
+ esa's mooc on [earth observation from space](https://www.imperativemoocs.com/courses/the-optical-view). <span style="color:gray">(notes)(solutions)</span>

One of my mantras is this quote by Georgia O'Keeffe:

> I do not like the idea of happiness -- it is too momentary. I would say that I was always busy and interested in something -- interest has more meaning to me than the idea of happiness.

## 

My name is Zul. I'm from KL, Malaysia and I like to learn more about the universe. 

Currently, I'm focusing on solving all the problems from abbott's understanding analysis. See my [solutions](https://zulfadz.github.io/abbott-solution/) and [notes](https://zulfadz.github.io/abbott/).

I am also working on other projects. Notes and solutions will be posted as soon as they become available:

+ coursera on [computers, waves, simulations: a practical introduction to numerical methods using python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computers-waves-simulations). <span style="color:gray">(notes)</span>

+ sheldon's linear algebra done right. <span style="color:gray">(notes)(solutions)</span>

+  python programming and numerical methods: a guide for engineers and scientists. <span style="color:gray">(notes)(solutions)</span>

+ esa's mooc on [earth observation from space: the optical wiew](https://www.imperativemoocs.com/courses/the-optical-view). <span style="color:gray">(notes)(solutions)</span>

+ aops' counting and probability. <span style="color:gray">(notes)(solutions)</span>

The only way to mastery is through small daily improvements. This is why reviewing and journaling each day is very important. You can read my [journal](https://zul.rocks/journal/) here.

title: Log - 7 weeks of creating art
---


##### Week 1: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made color mixing of three types: palette mix, glazing and paper mix. I used pthalo blue and orange, which when combined look something like burnt umber (cobalt blue and rose would have produced purple). I used these pointy brushes, Im not too sure what they are called. But ideally I would want to use round brush which will hold more water I think. 


**Thoughts:** I spent longer than expected on this. About 1 hour to 1 hour and a half. Mainly because I was looking for brushes, color, palettes and cups. Also, maybe I need to stack up a bit more equipments. Namely, round brushes, cobalt blue and roses watercolor. For the next round, I want to draw thumbnails, which would require a pen, sharpie, graphite stick. Next time, I would stick to 30 mins.

##### Week 2: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Drew a thumbnail of a building in paris. Materials used are round brush, fountain pen, carbon ink, tombow dual brush 947, n75, n95, and a gel pen.


**Thoughts:** Doing art in the morning really works well. This is probably one which would I most easily not do in other time of the day due to heat and just for the fact that it's a new habit, one which has been the least ingrained in me.

##### Week 2: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started Kate Sutton's illustrative journaling course. No real painting is done yet. We mostly went through her background and the equipments needed.


**Thoughts:** Two art sessions this week! Each also under 1 hour. Very nice.

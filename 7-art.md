title: Log - 7 weeks of creating art

##### Week 1: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made color mixing of three types: palette mix, glazing and paper mix. I used pthalo blue and orange, which when combined look something like burnt umber (cobalt blue and rose would have produced purple). I used these pointy brushes, Im not too sure what they are called. But ideally I would want to use round brush which will hold more water I think. 


**Thoughts:** I spent longer than expected on this. About 1 hour to 1 hour and a half. Mainly because I was looking for brushes, color, palettes and cups. Also, maybe I need to stack up a bit more equipments. Namely, round brushes, cobalt blue and roses watercolor. For the next round, I want to draw thumbnails, which would require a pen, sharpie, graphite stick. Next time, I would stick to 30 mins.

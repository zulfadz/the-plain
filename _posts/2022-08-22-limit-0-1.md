> Given a sequence such that $$x_{n} \to x$$. Moreover, for all $$n$$, $$x_{n} \in \mathbb R/(0,1)$$. Is $$x$$ also in $$\mathbb R/(0,1)$$?

Suppose $$x$$ is in $$(0,1)$$. Then there exist an entire neighborhood around $$x$$ comprising of elements in $$(0,1)$$. For instance, pick some $$0<\epsilon<\max(|a−0|,|a−1|)$$. Since $$x$$ is the limit of $$(x_{n})$$, there is some $$x_{n}$$ in this neighborhood. But this contradicts $$x_{n} \in \mathbb R/(0,1)$$ for all $$n$$. Hence $$x \in \mathbb R/(0,1)$$.

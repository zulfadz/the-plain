> Suppose $$(x_{n}) \to x$$. Is it true that $$ \lim f(x_{n}) = f(\lim x_{n})$$?

Certainly, we can find many examples where the above statement is true. For instance, the polynomial $$f(x_{n}) = ax_{n}+1$$ for some integer $$a$$ will converge to $$f(x) =ax+1$$.

But this statement is not true when considering discontinuous function. For instance, let $$x_{n}=1/n$$. Define $$f(x_{n})=1$$ if $$x_{n} \neq 0$$ and $$f(x_{n})=0$$ if $$x_{n}=0$$. 

Then $$f(x_{n})$$ is equal to $$1$$ for all $$n$$. Thus, $$\lim f(x_{n})=1$$ but $$f(\lim x_{n})= f(0)=0$$.

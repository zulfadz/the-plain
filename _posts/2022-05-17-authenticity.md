The problem with authenticity is that it is a form of selfishness.[^1] A means to say whatever we have in mind, to act on our impulses. Certainly, it is an excuse to be self-absorbed and self-entitled.

A better [approach](https://seths.blog/2017/10/defining-authenticity/) is to be consistent. A consistent person keeps their promises. They are true to their words. They act the same way whether people are looking or not.

A consistent person shows up. They feel like it, or don't feel like it, it doesn't matter. They show up.

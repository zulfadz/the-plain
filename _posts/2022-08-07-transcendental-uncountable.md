In the previous [post](https://zul.rocks/algebraic-countable), we have shown that algebraic numbers are countable. What about real numbers that are not algebraic, namely _transcendental_ numbers?

Let $$A$$ be the set of algebraic numbers and $$B$$ the set of transcendental numbers, then:

$$\begin{align*}
  A \cup B = \mathbb R
  \end{align*}.$$

Suppose $$B$$ is countable. And we already know that $$A$$ is countable. The union of two countable sets is countable, which implies that $$\mathbb R$$ is countable. But this is a contradiction, since $$\mathbb R$$ is uncountable by a variation of Cantor's Theorem.

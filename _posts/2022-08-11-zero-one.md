Consider some infinite sequence $$(x_{n})_{n \geq 1}$$ in $$[0,1)$$. For instance, we can define $$x_{n} = (1/n-1)$$, which will result in the following sequence 

$$\begin{align*}
  0 = x_{1} < x_{2} < x_{3} < \cdots <1
  \end{align*}.$$

Clearly, the set of the elements of this sequence is a subset of $$[0,1)$$. Then we can define $$f: [0,1) \to (0,1)$$ by 

$$\begin{align*}
  f(x)=\begin{cases} x_{n+1} &\text{if $x =x_{n}$ for some $n \geq 1$} \\ x &\text{if $x \neq x_{n}$}.\end{cases}
\end{align*}$$

which is bijective. I really like this finding, because it shows how in infinite setting, we can simply map one element to the next term in sequence, which then shows their equivalence.

1. Reading Emily Dickinson has been a pleasure. This quote from one of her letters is stuck in my head:

> So busy missing you I have not tasted Spring.

2. I'm well into Chapter 3 of Axler's Algebra. So happy with my progress. I should publish all my solutions online.

3. An interesting advice from [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.substack.com/p/waiting-for-the-miracle), taken from [Mark](https://twitter.com/mlarson/status/1603758161101721601?s=20&t=-iXkLGUiaa5-rUqvQU4xdg):

> Make sure youâ€™re running toward something, and not just away from something!

Similar sentiment shared by the lead singer of [Marmalade](https://austinkleon.com/2019/01/10/oh-no-were-still-us/):

> I wanted to start over. I wanted a new life. The trouble was, I brought myself with me.

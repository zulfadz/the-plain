Is $$\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}(0,1 / n)$$ empty?

Suppose it is not empty. Then it contains some $$k$$, which is larger than $$0$$ and smaller than $$\frac{1}{n}$$ for all $$n \in \mathbb N$$. Archimedean Property states that:

>Given any real number $$x>0$$, there exists $$n \in \mathbb N$$ such that $$\frac{1}{n}<x$$.

$$k$$ contradicts Archimedean Property, and so it does not exist. $$\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}(0,1 / n)$$ is empty.

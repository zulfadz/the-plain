##### Day 0: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did not manage to workout

##### Day 1: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A set of chest workouts, with one abs exercise and a 20 minute cardio (incline 14% with speed 4)

**Thoughts:** I had almost not found a parking spot, but managed to secure one empty illegal spot. People are truly _shopping_ these days. I wonder where they get the money from to be spending this much.

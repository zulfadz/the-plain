##### Day 0: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did not manage to workout

**Thoughts:** Went to gym at 4pm, and the building was actually overflowing with cars. It was impossible to even enter the building. Tomorrow I should come in the morning.

##### Day 1: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A set of chest workouts, with one abs exercise and a 20 minute cardio (incline 12% with speed 4)

**Thoughts:** I had almost not found a parking spot, but managed to secure one empty illegal spot. People are truly _shopping_ these days. I wonder where they get the money from to be spending this much.

##### Day 2: August 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A set of back workouts, with 20 minute cardio (incline 12% and speed 4)

**Thoughts:** This guy legit just came over and _used_ the pull-up bar when I was literally taking a quick pause from my set 1. Another guy then hovered behind me as I was using a machine, and asking me how many sets until I will be done. GTFO.

##### August 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Planned to go during lunch. But there's a meeting right before and after lunch. Damn.

**Thoughts:** Next time, let's not plan to go to gym during lunch _if_ there are meetings close to before or after it.

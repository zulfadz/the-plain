##### Day 0: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did not manage to workout

**Thoughts:** Went to gym at 4pm, and the building was actually overflowing with cars. It was impossible to even enter the building. Tomorrow I should come in the morning.

##### Day 1: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A set of chest workouts, with one abs exercise and a 20 minute cardio (incline 12% with speed 4)

**Thoughts:** I had almost not found a parking spot, but managed to secure one empty illegal spot. People are truly _shopping_ these days. I wonder where they get the money from to be spending this much.

##### Day 2: August 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: A set of back workouts, with 20 minute cardio (incline 12% and speed 4)

**Thoughts:** This guy legit just came over and _used_ the pull-up bar when I was literally taking a quick pause from my set 1. Another guy then hovered behind me as I was using a machine, and asking me how many sets until I will be done. GTFO.

##### August 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Planned to go during lunch. But there's a meeting right before and after lunch. Damn.

**Thoughts:** Next time, let's not plan to go to gym during lunch _if_ there are meetings close to before or after it.

##### Day 3: August 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Managed to do leg workout at night (drove from home 8pm)

**Thoughts:** Today is very meaningful. Namely I faced many resisting urges to abort workout today. Initially planned to do in morning, but woke late -- so lunch it was, but came lunch, I was starving, so I said let's do this in the evening -- came late evening, I was thinking there may be traffic jam. Finally I made my mind not to miss workout twice and willed myself to go at night.

##### Day 4: August 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went to gym (drove from office at 6.30pm) to do arm workout. It was supposed to be a tennis day, but it rained.

**Thoughts:** I was glad I went to gym but I couldn't help but feeling uncomfortable by the amount of people at the gym, and how some of them hovered around me. Boundaries, please. I might be disgusted enough to go during this time again.

##### August 5, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I was supposed to go to the gym in the evening, but i was in a 4h+ work call.

**Thoughts:** I don't really feel as bad for missing this. As some break is not bad. As long as not twice in a row.

##### Day 5: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Really glad I made it through today. Was not in the mood, but willed myself to go through a chest workout and a 25 min cardio.

**Thoughts:** Gym in the weekend evening is quite nice. Relatively quiet.

##### Day 6: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Back workout done. Plus two abs and one cardio.

**Thoughts:**  I'm getting weaker i think. Can barely do 28.5kg pulldown. Barely done pullups. Similarly, for other exercises. Probably because my meals were messed up yesterday (ate lunch at 4pm). Or I subconciously eating less because I've been getting comments that I'm fat. Tomorrow, let's aim to eat 5 times a day - by 7am, 10am, 1pm, 3pm, 7pm.

**Today's Progress**: Planned to go gym after maghrib. But ended up doing coursera on waves, which should be done at 6pm/6.30pm, but derailed by my abbott webpage not loading.

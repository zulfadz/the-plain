title: Log - 100 days of Abbott
---


##### Week 1: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished section 5 exercises.

**Thoughts:** 
Proof of Schr√∂der-Bernstein Theorem _kicked_ my ass. It took me about 4 hour (including one hour sanity break and dinner) to understand what was going on and get it done. I don't know. What should have I done differently? Perhaps pay specific focus to what the question wants (proof of pairwise disjoint), understanding the implication of the assumptions given (A not in g(Y), and $$A_{i} = g(Y)$$ imply disjoint sets) and experiment with contradiction (this helps to proof that g is onto). Anyhow, Anki reviews will be critical. Also, maybe next time I can stop after one hour, or at most 1.5 hour, to avoid burnout.

##### Day 2: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished four exercises (1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.6.4).

**Thoughts:** It was a fairly smooth session, except for a moment when I was falsely convinced that Cantor's Theorem would have worked for rational numbers too. I think Cantor's Theorem can be a blog post (or two blog posts). It took me 1h40min to complete the session.

##### Day 3: August 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished 4 exercises (1.6.5, 1.6.6, 1.6.7, and 1.6.8).

**Thoughts:** I thought Abbott did an amazing job guiding the readers on how to prove Cantor's Theorem. I managed to do everything, except for 1.6.4(b) which confounded me because now that we assumed $$a^{\prime} \notin B$$, I thought that's certainly a possibility. But this is ridiculous because it contradicts the definition of $$B$$.  I suppose I haven't fully internalized the definition. Anyhow, next time, we read the definition $$B = \{ a \in A : a \notin f ( a ) \}$$ as follows: $$a \notin f ( a ) \}$$ iff $$a \in B$$. Then it's clear that if $$a \notin B = f(a)$$ then $$a \in B$$ (Part B). Similarly, if $$a \in B = f(a)$$, then $$a \notin f(a)$$ (Part A).

##### Day 4: August 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did 1.6.9. But did not manage to finish after 1h30min. So I stopped.

**Thoughts:** I quite like this self-discipline to stop...

##### Day 5: August 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1.6.9.

**Thoughts:** This is a challenging question. I learned new techniques (and lessons from my mistakes)

##### Day 6: August 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished 1.6.10.

**Thoughts:** I learned a lot from this question. In particular using example of sets I've seen in the past, and making deductions whether some sets are countable or not.

##### Day 7: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Went through 2.1.

**Thoughts:** Proud of this. I got derailed this day, and ended up doing this at 815pm. Was very sleepy, so I took a break after 30min, and resume for another 30min.

##### Day 8: August 7, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished half of section 2.1.

**Thoughts:** I lovee how this is written. My favorite part is when sequences are also defined from topological perspective.

##### Day 9: August 8, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished up until exercises 2.1.4.

**Thoughts:** Sequences are pretty intuitive. Also I'm doing this in between work. Quite effective. Had issue with loading into webpage. It turns out I cant use three dashes anymore for hline. Need to use three asterisks.

##### Day 10: August 9, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Spent like 20min

**Thoughts:** Hard to pay attention because bosses are having meeting

##### Day 11: August 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished to exercises 2.2.7.

**Thoughts:** Interesting exercises on the definition of eventually and frequently!

##### Day 12: August 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished exercises 2.2.8.

**Thoughts:** Tripped by this question: If a sequence contains an infinite number of zeros, is it necessarily zero-heavy? But it becomes clear how to disprove this if I just re-phrase the definition of zero-heavy from: 

>if there exists $$M \in \mathbb N$$ such that for all $$N \in \mathbb N$$ there exists $$n$$ satisfying $$N \leq n \leq N + M$$ where $$x_{n} = 0$$

to

> given any $$M$$, there exists $$N$$ such that for all $$n$$ satisfying $$N \leq n \leq N + M$$,  $$x_{n} \neq 0$$.

title: Log - 100 days of Abbott
---


##### Week 1: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: 
Finished section 5 exercises.

**Thoughts:** 
Proof of Schr√∂der-Bernstein Theorem _kicked_ my ass. It took me about 4 hour (including one hour sanity break and dinner) to understand what was going on and get it done. I don't know. What should have I done differently? Perhaps pay specific focus to what the question wants (proof of pairwise disjoint), understanding the implication of the assumptions given (A not in g(Y), and $$A_{i} = g(Y)$$ imply disjoint sets) and experiment with contradiction (this helps to proof that g is onto). Anyhow, Anki reviews will be critical. Also, maybe next time I can stop after one hour, or at most 1.5 hour, to avoid burnout.

##### Day 2: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished four exercises (1.6.1, 1.6.2, 1.6.3, and 1.6.4).

**Thoughts:** It was a fairly smooth session, except for a moment when I was falsely convinced that Cantor's Theorem would have worked for rational numbers too. I think Cantor's Theorem can be a blog post (or two blog posts). It took me 1h40min to complete the session.

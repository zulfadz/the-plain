##### Day 1: July 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: This is actually not my first time doing anki. But it's my first day tracking it. Did this first thing in the morning. It took about 15 minutes.

**Thoughts:** Doing anki first thing in the morning has been working well so far.

##### Day 2: July 31, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Completed in about 17 minutes. But I still need to add questions from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** Doing this first thing in the morning really slaps. But my worry is that on weekdays, I may have to go to the gym early to avoid traffic, in which case, I don't know what should I do first. This, or gym?

##### Day 3: August 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished in 30 minutes. I did some while waiting for my parents to go to hospital, and resumed after driving them there.

**Thoughts:** I think this is the sweetspot of anki review. First thing first, day after day.

##### Day 8: August 6, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Took me about 25 minutes. A number of the questions are new questions. Took me sometime to think.

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking to also added to anki questions from earlier sections. But maybe I'll do that towards the end since I'm about to start chapter 2.
